IF YOU LIKE TO GAMBLE, 
I TELL YOU IM YOUR MAN
YOU WIN SOME, LOSE SOME, 
ALL THE SAME TO ME
THE PLEASURE IS TO PLAY, 
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT YOU SAY
I DONT SHARE YOUR GREED, 
THE ONLY CARD I NEED IS 
THE ACE OF SPADES
THE ACE OF SPADES
PLAYING FOR THE HIGH ONE, 
DANCING WITH THE DEVIL
GOING WITH THE FLOW, 
ITS ALL A GAME TO ME
SEVEN OR ELEVEN, 
SNAKE EYES WATCHING YOU
DOUBLE UP OR QUIT, 
DOUBLE STAKE OR SPLIT, 
THE ACE OF SPADES
THE ACE OF SPADES
YOU KNOW IM BORN TO LOSE, 
AND GAMBLINGS FOR FOOLS
BUT THATS THE WAY I LIKE IT BABY
I DONT WANNA LIVE FOR EVER
AND DONT FORGET THE JOKER
PUSHING UP THE ANTE, 
I KNOW YOU GOTTA SEE ME
READ EM AND WEEP, 
THE DEAD MANS HAND AGAIN
I SEE IT IN YOUR EYES, 
TAKE ONE LOOK AND DIE
THE ONLY THING YOU SEE, 
YOU KNOW ITS GONNA BE 
THE ACE OF SPADES
THE ACE OF SPADES
